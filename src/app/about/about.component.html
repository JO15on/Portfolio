                    I grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Growing up, I was involved in sports, and it became a passion of mine. It never waned when I went to college at the University of Michigan in which I was involved in coaching, being a fan of Michigan athletics, and continue to keep tabs on sports from all over the country.  This is when I decided to be involved in the sports industry by attending Xavier University for Sport Administration Graduate School program. I have worked all over the country, working for several Division 1 Athletic Department in Marketing as a Marketing Assistant. I was in charge of the marketing and promotions of the sports that I was responsible for while immersing myself in the Digital Marketing world. Breaking into the sport industry is incredibly difficult and was the finalist for several full-time positions in Digital Marketing at some of the Division 1 schools, but ultimately wasn't selected for the position. I honed my digital marketing skills by taking certification courses and an online class on HTML/CSS in the community college.  I knew that I wanted to stay in the digital world and have discovered Grand Circus.

                    I did my research on the Grand Circus and wanting to gather all possible information about this company which includes going to an info session and multiple workshops. This is when I knew that I had to dive into it by applying for the After Hours Front-End Web boot-camp. After 6 long months, I finally graduated with a certification in which I have developed multiple software languages that it usually takes 4 years for college students to learn. Grand Circus has given me a solid foundation towards becoming a software developer in the front-end.  I'm excited to begin my career in the tech industry as a software developer.
